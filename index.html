    <h1>History of JavaScript</h1>

    <h2>Origin and Creation</h2>
    <p>
      <u>JavaScript</u> was created in <strong>1995</strong> by <em>Brendan Eich</em>, a programmer at <strong>Netscape Communications</strong>.
      It was developed in just ten days and was initially called <em>Mocha</em>, then renamed to <em>LiveScript</em>, and finally 
      <strong>JavaScript</strong>. Despite its name, <u>JavaScript</u> has little to do with <u>Java</u>; the name was chosen as a 
      marketing strategy to ride on Javaâ€™s popularity. It was designed to make <em>web pages interactive</em>, allowing scripts to run 
      in the browser and respond to user actions like clicks and form submissions.
    </p>
  
    <h2>Standardization and Evolution</h2>
    <p>
      In <strong>1996</strong>, <b><i>JavaScript</i></b> was submitted to <strong>ECMA International</strong> for standardization, 
      which resulted in the <strong>ECMAScript</strong> specification. The first edition was released in <strong>1997</strong>. 
      A major milestone came with <strong>ECMAScript 6 (ES6)</strong> in <strong>2015</strong>, which introduced features like 
      <i>arrow functions</i>, <em>classes</em>, <em>modules</em>, and <em>let/const</em> for variable declarations. This standardization 
      was key to making JavaScript a stable and powerful programming language used across all modern browsers.
    </p>
  
    <h2>Modern Usage</h2>
    <p>
      Today, <u>JavaScript</u> is one of the core technologies of the <strong>World Wide Web</strong>, alongside <strong>HTML</strong> 
      and <strong>CSS</strong>. It now extends beyond the browser with server-side development enabled by <strong>Node.js</strong>. 
      Popular libraries and frameworks like <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Angular</strong>, and <strong>Vue.js</strong> have 
      expanded its capabilities, allowing the development of scalable, interactive web applications. Thanks to its 
      <em>flexibility</em>, large community, and constant evolution, <u>JavaScript</u> remains a critical language in 
      <strong>web development</strong> and <strong>software engineering</strong>.
